#Q)2)Write a program that simulates the way in which a user might choose a password.
#The program should prompt for a new password, and then prompt again. If the two passwords entered are the same the program should say "Password Set" or similar, otherwise it should report an error.

password1 = input("Enter a new password: ")
password2 = input("Enter the password again: ")

if password1 == password2:
    print("Password Set")
